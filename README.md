Cleartrader is a free open-source program offering a 2x1 forced matrix
program. It was inspired by a [2 x 1 Cycle system I ran
into](http://www.2x1cycle.in/faq.php). 


# Installation

## PayPal

Create `lib/Local/PayPal/Config.pm` and put your seller API data in it:

```perl
package Local::PayPal::Config;

use Moose;

has 'username' => ( is => 'ro', default => 'japh_api1.gmail.com' );
has 'password' => ( is => 'ro', default => 'PHAPHAPHJPAH' );
has 'signature' => (
    is      => 'ro',
    default => 'AJPAHIF-7gH5jPewBwlIkmD6heasdfasdf23MsBuP32UhD0dxRGk'
);

### Local modules

#### lib/Local/DBIx/DBH.pm

write a method which returns and instance of DBIx::DBH with connection
parameters. Here's an example:

```perl
package Local::DBIx::DBH;

use strict;
use warnings;

use base qw(DBIx::DBH);


sub fluxflex {

    $main::sharedssl      = 'disable';
    my $port = 3306;

    my $host = 'karuna.mysql.fluxflex.com';
    my $username = 'karuna';
    my $password = 'ghOwJ266QgI';

    my $config = DBIx::DBH->new(

        username => $username,
        password => $password,

        dsn => {
            driver  => 'mysql',
            dbname  => 'karuna',
            port    => $port,
            host    => $host,
        },
        attr => { RaiseError => 1 }
    );
}

1;

```

#### lib/Local/DB.pm

The sub `dbh` needs to return a DBI database handle to your
database. The way I do it is by creating an instance of DBIx::DBH via
the method above and then creating the DBI dbh from there:

```perl

package Local::DB;

use Moose;

sub dbh {
    use Local::DBIx::DBH;
    my $C = Local::DBIx::DBH->fluxflex;
    use DBI;
    my $dbh = DBI->connect( $C->for_dbi );
    warn "DBH:$dbh.";
    $dbh;
}

sub da {
    my ($self) = @_;
    use Local::DBIx::Array;
    my $dbx = Local::DBIx::Array->new;
    $dbx->dbh( $self->dbh );
    $dbx;
}

1;

```
